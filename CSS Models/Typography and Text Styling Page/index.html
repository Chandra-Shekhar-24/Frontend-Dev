    <h1>The Art of Clear Writing</h1>
    <p class="lead">Good typography improves readability and user experience. <strong>Strong text</strong> emphasizes points while <em>emphasis</em> gives subtle tone. <mark>Highlights</mark> draw attention.</p>
    <p>Different fonts and sizes help structure content. Line-height and letter-spacing provide breathing room. The first paragraph uses a big first letter and the opening line receives special styling.</p>
    <p>Small concluding sentence to balance the layout and show typical paragraph spacing.</p>
